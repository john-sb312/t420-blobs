Create a new folder for your mainboard under $(YOUR-COREBOOT-DIR)/3rdparty/blobs/mainboard/lenovo/t420 then copy descriptor, gbe and me to it.

I also included an old TianoCore build for the old 8MB SPI, can boot Windows 10 with working sleep but no audio through headphone jack. Main speaker worked fine. Otherwise everything else including headphone jack worked perfectly fine under any GNU/Linux distribution.
