Thinkpad's Coreboot experimenting
=================================

This is a collection of blobs I found and used for compiling Coreboot. You can extract any of these from your stock BIOS dump. If you want to try compiling Coreboot yourself or don't have access to your backed up dump, you can use any blobs you can find here.

Create a new folder for your mainboard under \$(COREBOOT_DIR)/3rdparty/blobs/mainboard/lenovo/${MODEL} then copy descriptor, gbe and me to it.
